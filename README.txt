This folder contains 4 jupyter files which can be run directly after installing the requirements.txt:

1)GRU.ipynb - Gated Recurrent unit model main file 
2)lstm.ipynb - LSTM main file
3)w2v.ipynb - Simple MLP main file

4)preprocess.ipynb - used for preprocessing and normalization of the dataset, and create "CleanedMovies.csv".


The "Results" folder contains the accuracy/loss graphs and confusion matrix for all the three models.

The "models" folder contains the model weights of all the three models, in addition it has the genism model weights.

The "IMDB Dataset.csv" should be downloaded in the same folder as the main jupyter files before running the 3 files
